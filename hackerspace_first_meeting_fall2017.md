MakerSpace Futures Meeting - Debbie

1. So what are the expectations? 
	1. Right now, space is really limited in terms of "open"? OK? 
	2. I have Ed Leave for Fall 2017, but wondering about summer?
	3. I don't know what my level of commitment to managing the space will be after Fall 2017.
	4. I have base-level funding for a student, but only until Winter 2018 (non-inclusive)
	5. How would you like me--or others--to be "present" in the space? 
		1. I could make it my office
		2. I could make it not my office

2. Mission Statement
	1. Do we want to build in a 3-year plan? A one-year plan? What might that look like? (ACTION)

3. Publicity / Domain
	1. I have sent notices to Allan Majanac in Engineering, but should we visit VPAC? Faculty-wide? 
		1. How do we answer questions about domain extension?
		2. Who takes on the fight or the justification claims? 
		3. Who is responsible for outreach? And what do we mean by that exactly? (ACTION)
	
4. Transition?
	1. What might it look like if I were NOT involved? Not saying I want out now... (ACTION)

5. Assets? 
	1. Do you want to say that the assets stay with the library? Where should these assets be catalogued? (ACTION)
	2.
