The New Hackerspace

Some of you might have noticed things afoot in the New Westminster campus library space formerly occupied by CEIT's I.D. card distribution office (which has now moved out front). We're in the early stages of moving in, but that space is now the library's Hackerspace. Generally, a Hackerspace is space where individuals curious about aspects of technology--computers, circuitry, 3D printers, games, virtual reality, etc.--come together to work on projects, sharing their knowledge, accessing equipment, and generating concepts or ideas for further exploration. 

In the library Hackerspace, members of the College community can access 3D printing technology, play with an Arduino (an open-source programmable platform used for building electronics projects), a Raspberry Pi (another, more robust, open-source programmable platform used for building electronics and running multimedia), and the myriad components that attach, build on, or augment these devices. Beyond access to this equipment, the Hackerspace is there to encourage creative thinking by helping introduce people to emerging aspects of design thinking and creative design--circuit stickers, 3D rendering, and wearable technologies, to name a few.

Right now, a few of us are in the Hackerspace working on a "minimum viable arcade console" that will recreate the tactile, visual, and auditory experience of early arcade games by leveraging a Raspberry Pi, old video equipment, and some pre-fabricated cabinetry. We're learning how to program a Raspberry Pi, fabricate the materials needed to build the console, "hack" the television, screens, and keyboard to work with the system, and a whole bunch of other unforeseen things about technology old and new. The collision of skillsets involved in completing the project encourages inter-disciplinary collaboration, builds out some ideas around applied learning in the classroom, challenges our expertise, and is just plain fun. 

While the "minimum viable arcade console" project is technology-oriented, not all projects need be. The Hackerspace is a space for "hacking"; whatever you want to hack, we'd love to see what you're up to. Are you an avid knitter? Well, come on down, maybe you can knit up a sweater for the "minimum viable arcade console"! That'd be great. The only real requirement is that you be open to failure, repetition, and alternative ways of doing things in a community. Like to work alone? That's fine, go ahead and use the space and its equipment without the expectation that you need to work on group projects, but at least tell us what you're up to so we can praise your efforts. 

At the same time, if you just want to come and talk about open pedagogy, see who's doing what with what, or talk about technologies in the classroom or post-secondary contexts, the Hackerspace is a great place to have informal discussions with like-minded (or like-in-need-of-explanation-because-I-just-don't-get-technology) people. The Hackerspace is there for the open exchange of emerging ideas, mostly about technology, but not always. We're also open to your interests wherever they might be. We're interested to see how we might take what you know and connect that knowledge with what others might know to make or do something great. 

For now, the Hackerspace in the library is an emerging space--we haven't even fully moved in yet. We certainly haven't "nailed down" what it will be, what it wants to be, or what students and the College community might want from it. But it is there, and that's a start.

**Any** member of the College community can drop by the Hackerspace and talk to someone during our open hours:

Tuesday: 10:30 - 12:30 
Thursday: 10:30 - 2: 30
Friday: 10:30 - 12:30

We're in the New Westminster campus library, first floor, next to the elevator and across from the computer banks. We've got big windows, so feel free to come and peer in when the door is closed.
