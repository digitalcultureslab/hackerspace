Agenda:

I. Project Expectations / Outcomes 

1. What do you mean by competent literary skills? What will they need literary skills for? 
- I think they mean “literacy” here; they’re looking for competent language speakers.
- Looking for competency in language and writing skill.
- Writing is a major part of what we’re asking them to do; do not want skills of students encumbered by inability to communicate effectively.

2. Tell us how students might work with the research project objectives exactly: 
a. How will they engage with the documents exactly? (I.e.: digitization, presentation, cataloguing?)
b. Will the students be making their own decisions around the materials? How will they be supervised and what expectations might you have for their role in the outcomes?
	i. Will you define cultural memory?
ii. What do you mean by its “radical projection?” and how will students be involved in that? (See 2 above for reference)
3. Are the “engagements” what we might call areas of contact? Is this what students will be engaging with? (Oral histories, archives, etc.)
	a. How will students use these materials or in what venue will they put them into 
practice?
		- Classroom presentation?
		- Exhibit (OnLine or geographic)?
		- Catalogue?

- Resources at NWM + NWPL and are split between; students to collate this material between the two resources.
- We don’t want to limit the possibilities for the students but we do need deliverable tasks for them to do.
- Prioritizing tasks about Chinatown: catalogue all material, contextualize all material, interpret or animate the material. Consider how to present material. Curatorial research. Consider students as apprentices of local history.
- Goal: create a satellite exhibit in the material here at the college related to the existing professional exhibits?
- Imagination factor: what is the future of this space.
- Importance of giving students guidance and structure to shape their exploration. Focus students on discrete responsibility.
- We will have to push them to do something interesting, thinking new, interesting ideas.
- Thinking about the materiality of the digital.
- Advancing Chinatown into some other contexts (shop displays, restaurant windows).
- Focusing students on knowledge transfer (not entertainment): move students away from “what is this” to “what does it do.”
- Creating something that has not existed before.
- Resource. Cataloguing. Display and Exhibit.
- Form network of student iterations early.

4. Could you give us some concrete examples of how you see the outcomes from connectivity section. Are the outcomes pedagogical--to assist with teaching--or curatorial--to help organize, display or engage with museum materials?
	a. Some examples of concrete examples:
	- a website resource?
	- a display resource (practical  / exhibit)?
	- a series of pedagogical kits? (cultural animation)

II. Project Timelines / Timeline Expectations

1. Project would to start on _________________
2. Project would need to be done by _________________

- Dave and Brenna each one student for once a week meeting at 15 hours / week (David and Meirion) to attend when they can. We would aim for students to complete these projects in December (likely web-based).
	- Start with two exhibits (two students).
- From there we build on the short-term goal. Potential longer term goals include gallery exhibition space, exhibits in and around the city, classroom workshopping, theatre and spoken-word / stagecraft, etc.
- Allows DCLab to reflect on process and supervision.
- Job posting mid-August, first meeting with students around September 15.

III. Personal Expectations / Outcomes

1. Briefly, what are your personal expectations for the project and the students involved in it?
	- student-centered learning -- it’s all about them
	- curatorial innovation -- an opportunity to push curatorial practices
	- community engagement -- getting the community interested and fostering a museum 
infrastructure for continued community involvement
	- credibility and power








IV. Working with the College  Expectations (IF TIME…)

1. Our student involvement means the College would share equally in all IP emerging from the project; no ownership or single credit for anything that emerges from the project -- rights are co-owned and need to be respected if project outcomes result in travelling, maintenance, repurposing. 

2. Subject to all College policies -- we will need to get clearance on a few things before proceeding.

3. Do you know what you are getting into?
